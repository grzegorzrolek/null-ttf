NULL THE TRUETYPE FONT

This font is null. It's the smallest possible TrueType binary still valid
on OS X and with most of its bytes wiped out. It is used in hard-core font
production as a base for further compilation.


THE STRATEGY

These are the required tables only. Format of each is chosen for the font's
shortest overall length and each is stripped to a bare minimum. Remaining
words are wiped out wherever possible. See the dumps for comments on each
single word in each table.


FURTHER HACKING

The source files represent dumps of raw hex data that can be fused back
by OS X Font Tools. You can, of course, hack the binary itself. In fact,
this would allow to wipe out some additional bytes, which would otherwise
be restored by every sane font table fuser.


TODO

It would be nice to have it validating on other platforms too, but that
should rather imply separate binaries to keep things really tight and tidy.

Note that ftxvalidator still spits few warnings, some of them technically
unjustified. Preventing either type although increases font's size, it
makes the logs look nicer. It's not yet decided if that should take the
priority.
